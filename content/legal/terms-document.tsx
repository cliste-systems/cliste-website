          Cliste provides a SaaS platform including an AI voice agent for inbound
          calls, a dashboard (calls, Action Inbox, contacts, routing, agent
          setup), and optional SMS/email notifications. Platform subscription
          and usage are billed via Stripe Billing. We may add or change features
          as the product evolves.

      <LegalSection title="7. Service levels">

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="9. Liability">
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by Irish law, Cliste&rsquo;s aggregate liability
          in any 12-month period is capped at fees paid in that period. We exclude

          within 30 days, subject to legal retention.
